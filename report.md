## Introduction

We chose Olympic and global GDP datasets to analyse the history of people and countries who have achieved highly in worldwide sports and compare this with GDP. We aimed to uncover trends between the economies of different countries and their impact on success in sports. The first dataset our project uses is `olympics.csv`, downloaded from TidyTuesdays but was scraped and wrangled from [www.sports-reference.com](http://www.sports-reference.com) in May 2018 (Harmon, 2024). The dataset contains 15 columns and 271,116 rows detailing athlete data and medal results from summer and winter Olympic events from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. The column names include athlete ID number, sex (M/F), age, height (cm), weight (kg), team, National Olympic Committee (three-letter code for the country), games (Olympic game athlete competed in), year (of Olympic game), season (summer/winter), city (Olympic host city), sport, event (specific sports event), and medals (gold, silver or bronze if achieved). Overall, the dataset was detailed and comprehensive, but it required cleaning to remove duplicate rows and non-medallists, conversion of team names (e.g. United States, United States-1, and United States-3 all converted to United States), and host cities mapped to host countries.

The second dataset used is `Countries GDP 1960-2020.csv`, which is obtained from the World Bank national accounts and OECD National Accounts data files. It contains 120 rows and 63 columns, detailing country/region names, country codes (3 letter code), and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for every year from 1960 until 2016 (60-year period). Gross Domestic Product (GDP) represents the total value added by all resident producers in an economy, measured at purchaser’s prices. It is calculated as the sum of gross value added by all producers, including product taxes while subtracting any products subsidies. KEY IMPORTANCE AND ANY PROBLEMS…
